-- Migrate existing specialist cities from profiles.city VARCHAR field to specialist_cities table
-- This preserves existing data while transitioning to the new multi-city system

-- NOTE: After checking the database schema, the profiles table does NOT have a 'city' column
-- Therefore, there is no existing data to migrate
-- This migration is kept as a placeholder for documentation purposes
